Diabetes: Whether the person has diabetes (Yes/No or 0/1).
Hypertension: High blood pressure status (Yes/No).

FamilyHistory: History of similar diseases in the family.
Medication: If the individual is currently taking prescribed medication.
PreviousHeartAttack: Has the person experienced a heart attack before? (Yes/No).
StrokeHistory: History of strokes.



Clinical Tests & Symptoms
1. ChestPainType
This describes the nature of the chest pain the patient experiences. It's a key indicator in diagnosing heart disease.
Typical angina: Classic chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart (often caused by exertion, relieved by rest or nitroglycerin).
Atypical angina: Chest discomfort that doesn't meet all the criteria of typical angina but may still be related to the heart.
Non-anginal pain: Chest pain not related to heart conditions (e.g., muscular or gastric causes).
Asymptomatic: No chest pain at all — particularly dangerous, as heart disease can be silent in some people.
Encoding example: 0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical, 2 = Non-anginal, 3 = Asymptomatic.

2. ECGResults (Resting Electrocardiogram Results)
An ECG (or EKG) measures the electrical activity of the heart. The result gives clues about heart rhythm, past heart attacks, and current ischemia.
Common encodings:
0 = Normal
1 = ST-T wave abnormality: Indicates mild ischemia (restricted blood flow to the heart muscle).
2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy: Thickening of the heart’s left ventricle, often due to long-term hypertension.
Why it matters: These abnormalities suggest structural or electrical problems in the heart — critical for diagnosis.

3. MaxHeartRate (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
Measured during a stress test, usually with exercise (like treadmill walking).
Formula for estimation: 220 - Age
Lower-than-expected peak HR may mean poor cardiovascular fitness or a sign of ischemia.
Higher HRs during stress testing can be normal unless accompanied by symptoms or ECG abnormalities.
Clinical Insight: A heart that doesn't respond well to exercise may be at risk, even if symptoms aren't visible.

4. ST_Depression (ST Segment Depression Induced by Exercise)
This measures how much the ST segment drops below the baseline during the stress test (in mm).
ST segment depression is a strong indicator of myocardial ischemia.
A depression of >1 mm is often clinically significant.
It represents a lack of oxygen to the heart muscle during exertion.
Why it’s important: Combined with chest pain and abnormal ECG, this becomes a key diagnostic marker for CAD.

5. ExerciseInducedAngina
Indicates whether chest pain occurs during physical exertion (like treadmill exercise test).
Yes (1): Pain occurred during the test — indicates potential heart problem.
No (0): No pain during stress — less suspicious but doesn’t rule out heart disease.
This is a binary symptom and one of the oldest and simplest ways of diagnosing exertion-related heart issues.

6. Slope (of Peak Exercise ST Segment)
The slope tells how the ST segment changes after exercise. It gives a visual idea of how the heart reacts under stress.
Upsloping (0): Often considered normal or less worrisome.
Flat (1): May suggest ischemia (lack of oxygen).
Downsloping (2): Strong indicator of significant myocardial ischemia.
A flat or downsloping ST segment with exercise is very suspicious for CAD.

7. NumberOfMajorVessels (0–3) Colored by Fluoroscopy
This is a result from coronary angiography, where a dye is injected and visualized under X-rays (fluoroscopy) to check for blocked arteries.
The number indicates how many major coronary vessels show blockage or abnormalities.
Range: 0 (no vessels affected) to 3 (three major vessels affected).
The higher the number, the higher the risk of serious coronary disease.

8. Thalassemia
A genetic blood disorder affecting hemoglobin levels — impacts oxygen transport in the blood.
Typical encodings:
1 = Normal
2 = Fixed Defect: Suggests permanent damage to part of the heart.
3 = Reversible Defect: Suggests that damage appears during stress but not at rest — indicating ischemia.
In context of a nuclear stress test, "fixed defect" might imply a prior heart attack, and "reversible defect" indicates ischemia that may still be treated.


Target Variable
Outcome: The target or label — whether the individual has a disease or not (0/1 or Yes/No).
